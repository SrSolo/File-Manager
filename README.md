Creative Portion: 

1. Scrolling CSS animation
   For part 1 of our creative portion, we decided to learn advanced CSS techniques (in particular CSS animations, keyframes, translations, and transformations). On the homepage of the site, we added a name scrolling CSS animation using these CSS techniques (mentioned in the previous sentence) to display different WashU CSE Professors Names scrolling on the page.
2. Account Creation Feature
   On the main page, we added the ability for users to create new accounts for themselves.  
3. Text file creation
   Logged in users are able to create and write to a text file they name.
   If the file name already exists, the inputted text appends to the already existing file, otherwise a new file is created and the inputted text is added to the new file. Users can then access these files (with the ability to view and delete) as normal on their logged in page.
